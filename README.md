# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented in JavaScript. The game is played in the console, and the player competes against the computer in a best-of-five format.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Open the browser's console to view game results and prompts.
3. Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) when prompted.
4. The game will display the results of each round and declare the overall winner at the end of five rounds.

## Files

- `index.html`: HTML file to link to the JavaScript file.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the game logic.
  
## How It Works

- The computer's choice is randomly generated using the `getComputerChoice` function.
- Each round is played using the `playRound` function, which compares the player's and computer's choices.
- The game function runs five rounds, updating scores and declaring a winner at the end.
